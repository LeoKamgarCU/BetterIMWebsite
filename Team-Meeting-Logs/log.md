### TA Team Meeting Log

- Decisions made
- Alternative actions/options discussed
- Follow-up items, including agreed-on roles and responsibilities


Meeting 1:
- Should make a plan for who does what for this week
-  Make high-level plan for which features should be finished when
- Small commits everyday
- Start putting the meeting minutes and project updates into markdown, so that you can commit that too and its visible
- Make sure that everyone has at least 1 issue on the project board to work on every week
- Prioritize important features

Meeting 2:
- The plan needs to be a separate checklist on the github project page in the icebox; adding to the board is not sufficient
    - We need a plan for last week and this week
- Release notes must be automated
    - We must be making pull requests for each commit so that they can be automatically generated
- We need to continue updating the project board


Meeting 3:
- Went over previous plans and next plan
- Demoed project
- Find a way to display all game data on one page
- Probably don't need a FAQ page
- Probably don't need a messages page, because teammates will have eachother's phone numbers already.

Meeting 4:
