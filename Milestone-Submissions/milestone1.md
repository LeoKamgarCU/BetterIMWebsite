Application Name: IMProved: The simple, fast platform for intramural sports

Application Description: 

The purpose of IMProved is to provide a simple, fast, visually appealing, and easy to use application for the participation in and management of intramural/club/recreational sports leagues. The app will provide players with a way to organize and structure their teams and stay up to date on their teams. 

Our web app will allow users to register an account as a player and then log in. Once logged in, the user will have a number of options. The user will be able to create a team, view/join/leave teams, and view other players. Users who are team captains will be able to delete or edit their teams. Teams can be created in different leagues for various sports. In each league, games will be scheduled for teams to play against each other. Game results will be logged by team captains as well as team records. You can also view/schedule games through this website via a calendar interface. The user interface will also allow for searching/filtering by team/player name and/or sport. The user will be able to modify their profile and add information such as age/year, sport, name, and more. The user will also be able to log out of the app.

The website will use a database to store the various leagues, teams, games, and players. The players can each individually access their own games and schedules, so each user will have a personalized experience when they log in. We may also use an API in the application depending on if we decide to  implement additional features, such as using the Google Calendar API to integrate events with usersâ€™ personal calendars, as opposed to a fully functional calendar built from scratch. We may also add a ranking system for players and teams.

Vision Statement: 

For college kids and anyone else who need an easy way to manage their intramural, club, or recreational athletic teams. IMProved is a web app that offers a simple, fast, and intuitive way to explore, join, and create teams. Unlike IMLeagues.com, our product is not full of ads and confusing, buggy multi-step interfaces.
